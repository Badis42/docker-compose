IMPORTANT: If you are using Docker Toolbox (boot2docker),
please make sure to configure a share folder between
your machine and the boot2docker virtual machine with VirtualBox.

My share folder on my docker host (meaning the boot2docker VM) is located at `/boot2docker-shared`

Just put your `inventory.yml` and `playbook.yml` in the shared folder
